# Dev Corpus Ontology Schema (v1.0)

This ontology schema defines the structural, epistemic, and metaphysical contract
for all Upaniṣad corpus files in the Dev Bhagavān system.

It encodes:

- Participatory revelation
- Performative Advaita–Bhakti dynamic
- Karma as relational field (pragmatically operative, non-binding)
- Non-reductive category transcendence
- Linguistic exhaustion at culmination
- Doubt dissolving through recognition

> moksha_model: irreversible-contextual-clarity
> teaching_model: contextual-invitation + embodied-stability

# I. Text-Level Ontology (Required at Top of Every File)

Each Upaniṣad file must define:

text_role:
macro_prakriyā:
interaction_mode:
advaita_bhakti_dynamic:
epistemic_model:
ontology_model:
doubt_resolution:
karma_status:
immortality_model:
macro_arc:

---

## text_role

Allowed values:

- participatory-self-revelation
- progressive-unveiling
- ontological-destabilization
- relational-consummation

Default model:
participatory-self-revelation

---

## macro_prakriyā

Global movement of the text.

Examples:

- progressive-deobjectification
- paradox-to-recognition
- discrimination-to-identity
- relational-collapse

---

## interaction_mode

Defines student-text relationship:

- participatory-revelation
- destabilizing-dialogue
- guided-discrimination
- contemplative-invocation

---

## advaita_bhakti_dynamic

Allowed values:

- performative-interdependence
- hierarchical-integration
- contextual-expression
- non-differentiable-at-consummation

Default:
performative-interdependence

---

## epistemic_model

How knowledge functions:

- recognition-not-acquisition
- scope-clarification
- deconstruction-of-categories
- linguistic-indication

---

## ontology_model

Brahman–world relationship:

- non-diminishing-fullness
- apparent-superimposition
- relational-expression
- category-transcendent

---

## doubt_resolution

- argumentative-resolution
- dialectical-resolution
- participatory-dissolution
- apophatic-collapse

Default:
participatory-dissolution

---

## karma_status

- binding-mechanism
- provisional-discipline
- relational-field
- expressive-of-fullness
- pragmatically-operative-nonbinding

Default model:
relational-field
pragmatically-operative-nonbinding

---

## immortality_model

- post-mortem-continuity
- rebirth-cessation
- unborn-recognition
- rasa-of-fullness
- dual-register (existential + ontological)

---

## macro_arc

Short arrow chain summarizing movement.

Example:
fullness → pervasion → non-binding action → category transcendence → de-objectification → linguistic exhaustion

---

# II. Verse-Level Schema (Mandatory Fields)

Each mantra must include:

tags:
prakriyā:
pedagogical_role:
adhikāra_level:
cognitive_mode:
dependencies:
ontological_scope:
relational_mode:

---

## ontological_scope

Specifies domain:

- pāramārthika
- vyavahāra
- dual-register
- scope-clarification

---

## relational_mode

Specifies Advaita–Bhakti dynamic per verse:

- advaita-explicit
- bhakti-explicit
- performative-transition
- non-differentiable
- category-transcendent

---

# III. Corpus-Wide Design Axioms

1. No verse is merely ethical — ethical instruction must resolve ontologically.
2. Devotional verses are not ontologically inferior.
3. Category distinctions must never be absolutized.
4. Identity statements are linguistic gestures toward the unsayable.
5. Death verses default to dual-register unless explicitly symbolic.
6. Karma is never ontologically ultimate.

---

# IV. Structural Types of Upaniṣads

Texts may be typed as:

- Revelatory (e.g., Īśa)
- Dialogical (e.g., Kaṭha)
- Compressed (e.g., Māṇḍūkya)
- Expansive-metaphysical (e.g., Taittirīya)
- Discriminative (e.g., Bṛhadāraṇyaka)
- Instructional-layered (e.g., Chāndogya)

All must conform to the ontology contract.
