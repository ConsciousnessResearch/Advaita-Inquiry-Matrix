## 1. Purpose

Advaita Inquiry Matrix (AIM) is a structured AI-assisted research architecture designed to automate pedagogical unfolding in Advaita Vedānta as far as possible, while retaining human oversight.

The system does not attempt to automate realization. It automates structured śāstra-based unfolding in response to a student's inquiries and conceptual state.

The human guru (designer of the system) remains:

- Curator of the corpus
- Guardian of doctrinal integrity
- Supervisor of pedagogical architecture
- Final authority in exceptional cases

## 2. Foundational Premise

In traditional Advaita Vedānta:

- Śāstra is the pramāṇa (means of knowledge)
- The guru unfolds the pramāṇa
- The qualified student (adhikārī) assimilates the teaching
- AIM constructs a Śāstra-oriented cognitive environment supporting this unfolding dynamically.

3. System Architecture Overview

AIM operates as a two-layer system:

3.1 Text Ontology Layer (Static)

Each textual unit includes:

- Sanskrit text
- Transliteration
- Translation
- Conceptual tags
- Prakriyā designation
- Pedagogical logic is not embedded into the text schema.

3.2 Pedagogical State Layer (Dynamic)

Tracks:

- Conceptual assumptions
- Recurring misunderstandings
- Exposure history
- Stability under negation
- Integration maturity
