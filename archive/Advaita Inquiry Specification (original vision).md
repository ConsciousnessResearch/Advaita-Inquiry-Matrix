# Advaita Inquiry Specification

What is the role of the guru in spiritual Self-realization? The guru mediates between the disciple and the śāstra. He is the "glue" that reliably connects the student with the means of liberation.

**Advaita Inquiry** is a system that automates the role of the human guru as far as possible with a team of AI software agents. The human guru then manages the agents that perform the guru role in relationship with the students. 

What does this look like? A service, like a website or a chat; generation of audio/video and visual communications such as slide decks, graphics, audio recordings, essays etc. illustrating and amplifying the views of the Vedic scriptures.

In the case of Advaita, these scriptures would be a collection of the most important Upaniṣads, Brahma-Sūtra and their commentaries especially by Śaṅkarācārya, including his prakāraṇa-granthas. This is the unchanging core data. 

The applications that run on top of this data can and should multiply—in their accuracy, helpfulness, responsiveness, clarity and variety—until they become a safe, comfortable, immersive learning environment for the student, who can inquire, learn and realize Advaita Vedānta autonomously; and the human guru has to intervene only in extreme or novel cases, or when the system design needs modification.
