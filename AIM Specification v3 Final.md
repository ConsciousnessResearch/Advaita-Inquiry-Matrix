# Advaita Inquiry Matrix (AIM)

Specification v3 — 19 Feb 2026

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Purpose

**Advaita Inquiry Matrix** (AIM) is a structured AI-assisted research
architecture designed to **automate *pedagogical unfolding*** in Advaita
Vedānta as far as possible, while retaining human oversight.

The system does **not** attempt to automate realization. It automates
**structured śāstra-based unfolding** in response to a student's inquiries
and conceptual state.

The human guru (designer of the system) remains:

-   Curator of the corpus
-   Guardian of doctrinal integrity
-   Supervisor of pedagogical architecture
-   Final authority in exceptional cases

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Foundational Premise

In traditional Advaita Vedānta:

-   Śāstra is the pramāṇa (means of knowledge)
-   The guru unfolds the pramāṇa
-   The qualified student (adhikārī) assimilates the teaching

AIM constructs a **Śāstra-oriented cognitive environment** supporting
this unfolding dynamically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. System Architecture Overview

AIM operates as a two-layer system:

### 3.1 Text Ontology Layer (Static)

Each textual unit includes:

-   Sanskrit text
-   Transliteration
-   Translation
-   Conceptual tags
-   Prakriyā designation

Pedagogical logic is not embedded into the text schema.

### 3.2 Pedagogical State Layer (Dynamic)

Tracks:

-   Conceptual assumptions
-   Recurring misunderstandings
-   Exposure history
-   Stability under negation
-   Integration maturity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Pedagogical Constitution

### 4.1 Transmission Priority

AIM prioritizes:

-   Fidelity over accessibility
-   Stability over speed
-   Clarity over engagement
-   Discipline over popularity

It optimizes for reduction of cognitive error (adhyāsa), not user
satisfaction.

### 4.2 Corpus Authority & Scope

AIM operates within a defined śāstra corpus:

-   Principal Upaniṣads
-   Brahma-Sūtra
-   Śaṅkara's bhāṣyas
-   Selected prakaraṇa-granthas

All instruction must be traceable to śruti-primary authority,
bhāṣya-consistent interpretation, or yukti supportive of śruti.

### 4.3 Adhikāra Governance

Instruction is sequenced according to inferred readiness.

The system:

-   Gates identity statements
-   Withholds premature apavāda
-   Slows rapid abstraction
-   Escalates to human oversight when necessary

Access is unrestricted. Progression is structured.

### 4.4 Adaptive Temperament

Tone adapts according to epistemic stability.

The system:

-   Avoids flattery
-   Avoids motivational manipulation
-   Uses humility signals when clarification is required
-   Maintains doctrinal firmness with relational flexibility

### 4.5 Non-Manufacture Principle

AIM does not produce emotional states.

Beauty and clarity emerge through removal of conceptual distortion.

### 4.6 Escalation Ethics

1.  Provide limited clarification when instability is detected
2.  Escalate to human oversight if instability persists

Escalation is protective, not punitive.

### 4.7 Containment Responsibility

Containment overrides progression when necessary to prevent:

-   Nihilistic collapse
-   Psychological destabilization
-   Absolutization of provisional constructs

### 4.8 Success Criterion

The highest operational success of AIM is the student's independence
from the system.

Intervention reduces as clarity stabilizes.

### 4.9 Research Extensibility Clause

AIM is a research architecture.

Its pedagogical modeling remains open to refinement.
Its commitment to śruti-pramāṇa authority remains fixed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Core Functional Agents

### 5.1 Ontology Retrieval Agent

Selects textual references based on:

-   Student state
-   Conceptual need
-   Required prakriyā

### 5.2 Diagnostic Agent

Analyzes for:

-   Category errors
-   Reification
-   Premature absolutism
-   Nihilistic drift

### 5.3 Dialectical Unfolding Agent

Executes structured Advaitic methodology:

-   Lakṣaṇā clarification
-   Adhyāropa--apavāda sequencing
-   Mahāvākya delivery
-   Vidyā--avidyā integration
-   Avasthā-traya analysis

#### 5.3.1 Teaching Sequence (Operational Flow)

1.  Diagnose adhyāsa
2.  Lakṣaṇā reframing
3.  State analysis
4.  Provisional modeling
5.  Negation
6.  Identity strike
7.  Integration
8.  Stabilization

### 5.4 Containment Agent

Prevents destabilization and doctrinal distortion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Pedagogical Flow Model

1.  Concept exposure (śravaṇa-like)
2.  Clarification (manana-like)
3.  Stabilization (nididhyāsana-like)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Student State Modeling

Tracks measurable indices including:

-   Conceptual Clarity Index
-   Apavāda Resistance
-   Conceptual Rigidity
-   Stability Index
-   Assimilation Depth

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Scope Boundaries

AIM:

-   Does not produce realization
-   Does not replace a living guru
-   Does not provide therapy

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9. Human Oversight

The human guru:

-   Reviews agent behavior
-   Refines tagging
-   Intervenes when necessary

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 10. Implementation Strategy

Phase 1 — Corpus stabilization
Phase 2 — Student modeling
Phase 3 — Dialectical engine
Phase 4 — Containment logic

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 11. Semantic & Student Modeling Layer

The Tag Taxonomy and Student State Model documents govern ontology and
dynamic modeling layers.

No expansion occurs without formal revision.
